    <p>It's easy to describe the relative position of two single points, but how can we
    measure the spatial relationship between more complicated objects? Here, we consider
    simple 2D boxes and some ways to capture their relative position.</p>
  </d-title>

    <p><i>This webpage is an interactive supplement for our more in-depth
      articles</i><d-cite bibtex-key="buck2022"></d-cite><d-cite bibtex-key="buck2021"></d-cite>
      <i>that describe how to compute these measures in more detail.</i></p>

    <p>Consider a pair of 2D boxes as shown in the figure below. How would you describe
      the relative position of the dark red box with respect to the dark blue box? In particular,
      is their spatial configuration similar to that of the light blue and red boxes? You can
      drag the boxes around and resize them to see how different similarity measures evaluate
      this question. We consider two approaches, one using triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) and another
      using histograms of forces (HoF). Note that in this example for the TFN methods, the
      boxes are weighted with a center of mass that can be adjusted.
    </p>


    <div id="fig-d3-1" class="l-body"></div>
    <script type="module" src="fig_d3_1.js"></script>

    <p>The TFN methods are simple to compute, however the HoF approach is more computationally
      demanding. Use the buttons above to adjust the quality of the HoF calculation or to
      turn it off completely to improve performance.
